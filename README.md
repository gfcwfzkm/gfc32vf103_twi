# gfc32vf103_twi
I2C Library for the GD32VF103 RISC-V Microcontrollers by GigaDevices

Tested with the GD32VF103T microcontroller as well as on the Longan Nano board.
Documentation and examples provided in the header file. Used the Atmel-style naming for I2C (aka TWI - two wire interface) to not clash with the firmware functions of GigaDevices.
